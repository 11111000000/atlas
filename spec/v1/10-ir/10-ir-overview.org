:SUMMARY: Core IR entities, invariants, extensibility model.
:END:

* Core Entities
- File: inventory item.
- Symbol: top-level program entity with stable :id.
- Edge: relation between entities.
- Summary: text/commentary snippet (optional).
- Fact: enrichment assertion with provenance (optional, additive).

* Invariants (MUST)
- IDs MUST be stable within a file across runs if source spans do not change.
- Keys MUST keep types across schema versions; new keys MUST be optional.
- Edge :type MUST be a canonical symbol/string; readers MUST ignore unknown types.

* Extensibility
- Additional fields MAY be added to files/symbols/edges; readers SHOULD ignore unknown keys.
- Facts carry enrichment and conflict resolution metadata (confidence, source, ttl).
