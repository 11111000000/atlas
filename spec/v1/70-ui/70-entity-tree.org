:ID: v1-70-entity-tree
:STATUS: Informative
:VERSION: 1.0
:UPDATED: 2025-10-14
:SUMMARY: Text-only entity-centric tree views: by-feature, by-kind, search, edges, plan.
:END:

* Views
- by-feature: feature → provider file → symbols (ordered by position).
- by-kind: function/macro/var/custom/const grouped and sorted by name.
- search: top-k results with in/out edges of selected file.
- edges: local neighborhood around selector (file/feature/id).
- plan: files and spans as built by planner (LLM budget-aware).

* UX invariants
- Deterministic ordering and stable headings; fold/unfold with markers ▸/▾.
- Open/peek/copy actions; optional icons via all-the-icons.
- Auto-refresh on index events when enabled.

* Integration
- Subscribes to event bus (:atlas-index-*) and reflects status line.
- No external deps; works in TTY.
