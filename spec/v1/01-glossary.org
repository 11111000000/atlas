:SUMMARY: Terms and definitions for Atlas specification.
:END:

* Terms
- IR: Internal representation of project structure in Atlas.
- File: A project file entry with :path, :size, :mtime, :lang, flags.
- Symbol: A top-level program entity (function, class, var, mode, etc.) with a stable :id.
- Edge: A relationship (:type, :from, :to) between entities (import/require/provide/call/ref/...).
- Summary: Text snippet or commentary bound to a file or symbol (optional).
- Fact: An enrichment assertion (subject/predicate/object) with provenance/confidence/ttl.
- APM: Atlas Prompt Map â€“ compact text export for LLMs.
- Provider: A source of data (Elisp, Tree-sitter, LSP, external CLI).
- Store: On-disk sexp persistence under .context/atlas/v1/.

* Conventions
- IDs are language-prefixed, stable within file ranges: LANG:REL#NAME@BEG-END/KIND.
- Edge types are canonical strings/symbols; new types may be added without breaking existing ones.
- Sexps use keyword symbols (e.g. :path) as keys; values keep stable types.
