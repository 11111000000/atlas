:STATUS: Informative
:VERSION: 1.0
:UPDATED: 2025-10-14
:SUMMARY: Clusters as first-class entities; LLM-driven and static grouping.
:END:

* Cluster entity
- ID: "cluster:ID"; label/name; members [symbol-ids]; centroid/notes optional.
- Facts:
  - (label "…"), (members [id…]), (source llm|static), (confidence X.Y), (ttl SECONDS).

* Membership
- Symbol-level fact: (cluster "cluster:ID").
- APM Enrichment: emit top clusters with labels and member counts.

* Generation
- LLM-based clustering over names/docs/edges; static grouping by directory/module/package boundaries as baseline.
