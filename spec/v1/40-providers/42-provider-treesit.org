:ID: v1-42-treesit
:STATUS: Normative
:VERSION: 1.0
:UPDATED: 2025-10-14
:SUMMARY: Generic TS grammar-based extractor for defs/imports/exports and limited calls/refs.
:END:

* Levels
- L0: inventory (by file extension/mode)
- L1: top-level defs (symbols), docstrings where available
- L2: imports/exports/reexports
- L3: limited call/ref extraction with per-file budget

* Requirements
- Emission MUST produce canonical :kind mappings and :lang tags.
- Missing grammar MUST degrade to heuristics or skip with clear logging.
