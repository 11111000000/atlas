:UPDATED: 2025-10-14
:SUMMARY: S-exp serialization rules and stability.
:END:

* Rules (MUST)
- Use printed Emacs Lisp forms (prin1) with stable keyword keys.
- File lists MUST serialize as a single list per file (full replace).
- Symbols/Edges MAY be replaced per-file when batch includes (:file REL).
- Readers MUST ignore unknown keys; writers MUST NOT reorder fields unnecessarily.

* Meta (plist)
- (:schema INT :project-root STR :generated-at FLOAT :counts (:files :symbols :edges :facts :summaries) :languages LIST :opts PLIST)
- Notes: :facts and :summaries in :counts are optional and MAY be omitted; readers MUST ignore unknown keys in :counts.
