:SUMMARY: Clean core, thin ports, determinism, extensibility, performance.
:END:

* Principles
- Clean core + thin ports: pure data modeling and transforms; effects at edges.
- Deterministic outputs: stable ordering, stable IDs, predictable exports.
- Extensible core: add fields/predicates without breaking readers; use facts for enrichment.
- Lazy, incremental, and budget-aware: scale to large repos.
- LLM-first exports: human-readable lines, compact facts, layered sections.

* Trade-offs (dialectic)
- Static precision vs speed → multi-level sources (L0..L3) + enrichment.
- JSON vs S-exp → S-exp as primary, JSON for interop.
- Language-specific depth vs universal schema → core plus per-language mapping matrices.
